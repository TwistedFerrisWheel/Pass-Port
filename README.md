This password manager will eventually have a Linux Installation, as well as a android app to download (F-Droid preferably)

However, at the time of writing this, it can handle an unlimited amount of accounts, cannot handle dupilcates however (DO THAT AT YOUR OWN RISK)
It will also encrypt accounts using a default set code in the source code. However, you can easily change by downloading the source, changing the key (Crypt.cs) and building the solution! So you can have whatever key you would like!

All Information used in this application is not sent to any servers either! It's all locally saved and kept on your machine (App Data) 
Just know that does mean it will not backup automatically! So make sure to backup your passwords and master password every so often!

Other than that, You're all set to use this if you so choose!
